# üì© Spam SMS Detection System

## üìö Objective
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can classify SMS messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam**.  
The project also demonstrates best practices in automatic dataset download, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

# üõ†Ô∏è Detailed Explanation of Code

## Step 1: Import Required Libraries
We import necessary libraries for:
- Data handling (`pandas`, `numpy`)
- Visualization (`matplotlib`, `seaborn`)
- Machine Learning (`scikit-learn`)
- Automatic dataset download (`kagglehub`)
- Model persistence (`joblib`)

This ensures the code is clean, efficient, and modular.

---

## Step 2: Download the Dataset Automatically
Using `kagglehub`, the dataset `uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset` is downloaded from Kaggle directly.  
This removes the need for manual file upload and shows an innovative approach to dataset handling.

```python
path = kagglehub.dataset_download("uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset")
```

---

## Step 3: Load the Dataset
We load the `spam.csv` file located inside the downloaded folder and keep only the necessary columns:
- **label** (ham/spam)
- **text** (SMS message)

Data cleaning is performed to remove unnecessary columns.

---

## Step 4: Data Cleaning
We check for missing values to ensure data integrity and rename columns for better readability.

```python
data.columns = ['label', 'text']
```

---

## Step 5: Preprocessing Labels
We map the labels:
- `ham` ‚Üí `0` (Not Spam)
- `spam` ‚Üí `1` (Spam)

This converts categorical output into numerical format suitable for machine learning models.

---

## Step 6: Feature and Label Split
We separate features (`X = text`) and labels (`y = label`) to prepare for model training.

---

## Step 7: Train-Test Split
The dataset is split into 80% training and 20% testing using `train_test_split` for unbiased model evaluation.

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

---

## Step 8: Text Vectorization
We use **TF-IDF Vectorizer** to transform SMS text into numerical vectors that represent importance of words.  
TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency) is a strong feature engineering technique for text classification.

```python
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X_train_vectorized = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
```

---

## Step 9: Model Training
We train a **Multinomial Naive Bayes** classifier, which is highly effective for text classification tasks like spam detection.

```python
model = MultinomialNB()
model.fit(X_train_vectorized, y_train)
```

---

## Step 10: Model Prediction
We use the trained model to predict labels for the test data.

```python
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_vectorized)
```

---

## Step 11: Model Evaluation
We evaluate the model using:
- **Accuracy Score**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **Classification Report** (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

This ensures a complete analysis of model performance.

```python
print(accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

---

## Step 12: Confusion Matrix Visualization
We plot the confusion matrix using Seaborn heatmap for a better visual understanding of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

```python
sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues')
```

---

## Step 13: New Message Prediction
A function `predict_message()` is created to predict whether any new input message is spam or not.

```python
def predict_message(message):
    message_vectorized = vectorizer.transform([message])
    prediction = model.predict(message_vectorized)
    return "Spam" if prediction[0] == 1 else "Not Spam"
```

Sample message is tested to show real-world usage.
